        Bug Fixes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>OXSkins</code> - it's now possible ( and preferred ) to specify the desired
            skin using an enum</li>
        <li>The CustomiseManager sample has a minor bug fix, which caused a very rare
            crash</li><li><code>OutlookStyleDemo</code> : Added ability to change skin type at run time,
      and improved overall skin support. </li>
        <li><code>COXBItmapMenu</code> : Fixed bug which caused documents to close when dirty
            without prompting &nbsp;</li><li><strong><span style="color: #1111bb; font-family: Courier New">COXFrameWndDock::MakeItDockable</span></strong>
      : Can now specify which sides to support and if we should dock immediately &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li><code>COXFrameWndDock::AttachMDIChild</code>
            : Allows users to specify the side to dock to, before it would dock to the first
            one that was available.&nbsp; Also fixed some docking bugs in this class.</li>
        <li><code>COXListEdit</code> : Added code to send a message to indicate editing has ended when the
            drop button is pressed.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><code>COXPropertyTree</code> : Added code to send a message to indicate editing has ended when
            focus is lost.</li>
        <li>Moved all the skinning drawing into seperate classes, so they are all handled polymorphically
            by the toolbox controls.</li>
        <li><code>COXSizeDockBar::TabAllDockedControlBars</code> : Added code so that the visible bar can
            be selected, via a pointer or by index.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><code>COXComboPickerCtrl::OnPaint</code> now checks if the OS version is 
	XP or higher, and if so it uses the default OS painting, else it does custom 
	painting for the combo box arrow</li>
	<li><code>COXCalendarPopup::OnPaint</code> : A bug (missing cast) has been 
	fixed which caused an error in VC++ 7.1 or higher</li>
	<li><code>COXDateTimeCtrl::OnDropDown</code> : The return value has been 
	changed from TRUE to FALSE, thus fixing a bad bug where the parent window 
	never gets to handle the notification.</li>

	minimize, and close items were shown in an un-skinned condition has been 
	fixed.</li>
	<li><code>COXSysInfo</code> has been updated to correctly identify all OSes 
	up to Windows Vista.</li>
	<li>The Cool Controls demo had a bug where the Listbox tooltips came up as

	<li>The Screen Grabber demo has been fixed to not crash on a multiple 
	monitor setup.</li>

  Docking Windows</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=403>
  <p>When a toolbar, menubar or a docking windows is being
  dragged the entire content is shown instead of just the outline. When it is
  being docked it snaps to its appropriate position before the user releases
  the mouse button. This behaviour is the same as the snapping toolbars and
  docking windows of Visual Studio .NET. </p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width=221>
  <p><b>Detachable tabs</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=403>
  <p>Two or more docking windows can be docked to the same area
  of then screen. When they are only one of the is shown and the others can be
  activated by clicking on the appropriate tab on the bottom. The user can
  click on a tab an drag it away, therefore separating a docking window from
  the group, hence the name "detachable tabs". Behaviour is similar
  but not identical to the detachable tabs of Visual Studio .NET</p>
  </td>
